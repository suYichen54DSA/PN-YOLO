# üåæ PN-YOLOv5: Prototypical Network Enhanced YOLOv5 for Automated Rice Growth Monitoring

---

## üìù Overview

PN-YOLOv5 is an innovative framework that integrates prototypical networks with YOLOv5 to enable automated monitoring of rice growth dynamics using UAV imagery. This project addresses the critical challenge of limited labeled agricultural data by introducing a novel two-stage training approach:

1. **Unsupervised Pre-training**: Leverages temporal information from unlabeled drone images to learn robust feature representations without requiring manual annotations.  
2. **Few-shot Supervised Fine-tuning**: Adapts the full YOLOv5 model integrated with the prototypical network for specific agricultural tasks using minimal labeled data.

The framework supports end-to-end monitoring across key rice growth indicators: phenological stages, pest/disease detection, and planting density estimation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Reduced annotation dependency**: Requires up to 80% less labeled data compared to conventional methods.  
- **Multi-task capability**: Single unified framework for phenology recognition, pest detection, and density estimation.  
- **Temporal-aware learning**: Utilizes shooting date metadata during the unsupervised phase to enhance feature learning.  
- **Field-ready performance**: Validated on real-world UAV imagery from Guangdong rice fields.  
- **Agricultural insights**: Converts detection results into actionable farming decisions.

## üèó Architecture

The framework consists of two complementary components:

1. **Next-ViT Backbone**  
   Specialized for phenological stage recognition, extracting rich spatial-temporal features from UAV imagery.

2. **Modified YOLOv5 with Prototypical Network Integration**  
   Tailored for object detection tasks including pest/disease identification and planting density estimation.

### Core Innovations

- Prototype Computation Module: Dynamically calculates class prototypes guided by temporal metadata.  
- Adaptive Triplet Loss: Adjusts the margin based on time intervals between images to improve feature discrimination.  
- Cosine Similarity Constraint: Ensures temporal coherence in the learned feature space.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Instructions

To fully leverage PN-YOLOv5‚Äôs capabilities, please follow this two-stage training procedure:

1. **Unsupervised Pre-training**  
   Train the model on large amounts of unlabeled UAV imagery, exploiting temporal metadata (shooting dates) to learn robust, temporally-aware features without annotations.

2. **Few-shot Supervised Fine-tuning**  
   After unsupervised pre-training, fine-tune the full YOLOv5 model integrated with the prototypical network on a small labeled dataset to specialize for phenology classification, pest/disease detection, and planting density estimation.
